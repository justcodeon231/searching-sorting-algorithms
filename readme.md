# Sorting and Searching Algorithms in Python

A comprehensive Python application that implements multiple sorting and searching algorithms. This app is designed to be both educational and practical, with detailed comments for readability and ease of understanding.

## üöÄ Project Overview

This project covers a variety of classic sorting and searching algorithms. It allows users to:
- Sort an array using different algorithms (e.g., Selection Sort, Bubble Sort, Merge Sort).
- Search for elements using Linear and Binary Search.
  
With detailed comments, this application is useful for students, developers, and anyone looking to understand or practice with foundational data algorithms.

## üß∞ Features

- **Sorting Algorithms:**
  - Selection Sort
  - Bubble Sort
  - Insertion Sort
  - Merge Sort
  - Quick Sort

- **Searching Algorithms:**
  - Linear Search
  - Binary Search (optimized for sorted arrays)

## üñ•Ô∏è How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/justcodeon231/searching-sorting-algorithms.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd sorting-searching-algorithms
   ```
3. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
4. Follow the prompts in the terminal to select your sorting and searching algorithms.

## üìÑ Code Structure

- **Sorting Functions**: Each sorting function has comments explaining its purpose and steps in the algorithm.
- **Searching Functions**: Linear and Binary search implementations for easy data look-up.
- **Main Function**: Controls the user interface, guiding users to select options and interact with the algorithms.

## üîç Example Usage

Sample output for sorting and searching:

```plaintext
Welcome to the Sorting and Searching Application
Enter numbers separated by spaces: 8 3 7 4 1

Choose a Sorting Algorithm:
1. Selection Sort
2. Bubble Sort
3. Insertion Sort
4. Merge Sort
5. Quick Sort
Enter your choice (1-5): 4

Sorted Array: [1, 3, 4, 7, 8]

Choose a Searching Algorithm:
1. Linear Search
2. Binary Search (Requires sorted array)
Enter your choice (1-2): 2
Enter the number to search for: 7
Element found at index 3
```

## üîß Built With

- **Python** ‚Äì A powerful, high-level programming language.
