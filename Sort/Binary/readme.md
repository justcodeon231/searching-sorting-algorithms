# Binary Search Algorithm

## Overview
This repository contains an implementation of the binary search algorithm. Binary search is an efficient algorithm for searching a sorted array by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half.

## Features
- Efficient searching with O(log n) time complexity
- Works on sorted arrays
- Returns the index of the target element if found

## Usage
To use the binary search function:

1. Ensure your array is sorted in ascending order.
2. Call the `binary_search` function with your sorted array and the target value.
3. The function will return the index of the target if found, or -1 if not found.
